                    <h3>First blog</h3>
                    <article>
                        <h1>I love science and technology</h1>
                        <p>Always who I hearer some related to the science or technology I would excite. My first contact with the technology  who I remember was with a radio of my mom, i liked arm and disarm the radio, whenever I disarm I kept looking all of components, I was curious their colors and how they come together the different component, also was much curious why moving the knob changed the station. This was my first approach to the technology and science.</p>

                        <p>I always liked math. Ever since I was a child I was doing well, whenever they did "contests" I was doing very well, in fact I won many of them. Unfortunately, indiscipline and immaturity kept me far from what today at 29 I want to be. A web developer. I think I still have time to focus and be able to do so, I will do my best to achieve it and if I can help many along the way, I will.</p>

                        <p>I decided to start with "frontend and backend" web development, however, I am very interested in data science, machine learning and that related to neural networks. I hope to become an excellent web developer and in the future specialize in one of the ones I mentioned.</p>

                        <p>At the moment I take it as a hobby, but I do hope to learn enough in less than 1 year to start looking for a job as a junior frontend and progressively improve all the skills that are required in the industry.</p>                    </article>
